## FAQ

### How Do I Use This?

There are two ways you can use SpotifyInfo:

1. Visit [spotifyinfo.netlify.app](spotifyinfo.netlify.app) and paste the Spotify track URL/URI into the input box.
2. Replace `https://open.spotify.com` of any URL/URI with `spotifyinfo.netlify.app`. Then click the "Fetch Data" button.

### How Does This Work? - Scraping

While the [Spotify developer Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) could have been used for this project. I weighed the pros and cons and chose to go with scraping the required content off the track page instead.

Some of the pros of the Spotify Web API are that it is more stable than scraping, it is more quicker than scraping, good documentation, officially suported, the API has many features and etc. Some of the cons of the Web API are that all requests made are tied to a single developer token, their [Developer Terms of Service](https://developer.spotify.com/terms/) must be followed and that a developer account is required to use the Web API.

### Why Is This Slower Than Spotify?

When you make a request for a song on SpotifyInfo, your request needs to be first scraped by the scraper from Spotify before the result can be shown to you. This causes a delay from when you make the request to when the result is shown.

### What Do You Do With My Data?

Nothing. Since we don't collect any user data we can't use it

### Why Is This Missing Functionality?

SpotifyInfo, is still a work in progress and new functionality is continually being developed. If you have a certain feature that you would like to see, feel free to open an issue on GitHub
